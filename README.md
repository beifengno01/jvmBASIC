jvmBASIC
========

A BASIC to JVM bytecode compiler

jvmBASIC is a bytecode compiler which is capable of consuming a BASIC file (.bas) and producing a JVM .class file. The JVM class file exposes a public class named after the input file and a public method "program()" which contains the generated bytecode.  The generated .class file also exposes a "void main()" method which enables the BASIC program to be run from the command line.

In order to use the generated .class file from Java code, the public class members "inputStream" and "outputStream" must be set, in order for the BASIC program to consume input and produce output.
